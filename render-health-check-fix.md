# ðŸš¨ Render Deployment Issue - Health Check Configuration

## Problem:
- Backend is still returning HTTP 400 errors
- Render health checks are failing 
- Deployment is timing out

## Immediate Fix Required:

### 1. Change Health Check Path in Render Dashboard
Go to your Render service settings and change:

**Current Health Check Path:**
```
/api/
```

**Change to:**
```
/health/
```

### 2. Alternative: Disable Health Check Temporarily
In Render Dashboard > Settings > Health Check Path:
- **Leave blank** or set to `/` to disable health checks temporarily

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The HTTP 400 errors suggest:
- CSRF token issues with health checks
- Possible Django middleware blocking requests
- ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration still incorrect

## Quick Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Test manually** once deployed:
   ```
   curl -X GET https://nexapdf-backend.onrender.com/health/
   curl -X GET https://nexapdf-backend.onrender.com/api/
   ```

2. **Check Django settings** - the issue might be:
   - CSRF middleware blocking health checks
   - Missing HOST header handling
   - CORS configuration conflicts

## Recommended Action:
1. **Disable health check path** in Render (leave blank)
2. **Let deployment complete** without health checks
3. **Test endpoints manually** after deployment
4. **Re-enable health checks** once working

The deployment should complete successfully without health check validation.
